# Python-Portfolio
This repository contains Python programs, progressing in difficulty over time based on my skill level.

Rock Paper Scissors
My first module is rock papers scissors, it allows you to play rock papers scissors with a auto 
generated computer move and you can pick how many games you would like to play with the computer. 
Based on the number of games you pick it can tell you who wins. I used try and except calls to avoid an
error which would stop the program.

Tic Tac Toe
My second module is tic tac toe! You can play tic tac toe with a computer doing random moves
which may not be too challenging but I haven't learned enough to make it more difficult yet.
It uses lists to store and output the board. It was also an introduction of long functions for me. 
I had to delete over 100 lines of code and rewrite until it was working well and didn't throw any error.
I used try and except calls in this program a lot to avoidpeople inputting garbage to trick the code
into breaking.

Prison Break Data Analysis
My third upload is of Juypiter Notebook where I took data from [List of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) Wikipedia article. And answered some asked questions while demonstrating and commenting on the code on itself.

FizzBuzz
My forth is a simple puzzle I found on a IT recuriters website which is called FizzBuzz to have you demonstrate your profency with programming. Sadly they would only accept the C language, and as I'm not the best versed in it I was unable to do it without help of documentation. Although this is my attempt in Python in Pycharm.
